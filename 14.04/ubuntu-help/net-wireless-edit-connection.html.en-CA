<dt class="terms"><span class="gui">SSID</span></dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">This is the name of the wireless network you are connecting to, otherwise known as the <span class="em">Service Set Identifier</span>. Don't change this unless you have changed the name of the wireless network (for example, by changing the settings of your wireless router or base station).</p></dd>
<dt class="terms"><span class="gui">Mode</span></dt>
<dd class="terms">
<p class="p">Use this to specify whether you are connecting to an <span class="gui">Infrastructure</span> network (one where computers wirelessly connect to a central base station or router) or an <span class="gui">Ad-hoc</span> network (where there is no base station, and the computers in the network connect to one another). Most networks are infrastructure ones; you may wish to <span class="link"><a href="net-wireless-adhoc.html" title="Create a wireless hotspot">set-up your own ad-hoc network</a></span> though.</p>
<p class="p">If you choose <span class="gui">Ad-hoc</span>, you will see two other options, <span class="gui">Band</span> and <span class="gui">Channel</span>. These determine which wireless frequency band the ad-hoc wireless network will operate on. Some computers are only able to work on certain bands (for example, only <span class="gui">A</span> or only <span class="gui">B/G</span>), so you might want to pick a band that all of the computers in the ad-hoc network can use. In busy places, there might be several wireless networks sharing the same channel; this might slow-down your connection, so you can change which channel you are using too.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="terms"><span class="gui">BSSID</span></dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">This is the <span class="em">Basic Service Set Identifier</span>. The SSID (see above) is the name of the network which humans are intended to read; the BSSID is a name which the computer understands (it's a string of letters and numbers that is supposed to be unique to the wireless network). If a <span class="link"><a href="net-wireless-hidden.html" title="Connect to a hidden wireless network">network is hidden</a></span>, it will not have an SSID but it will have a BSSID.</p></dd>

<p class="p">A <span class="link"><a href="net-macaddress.html" title="What is a MAC address?">MAC address</a></span> is a code which identifies a piece of network hardware (for example, a wireless card, an Ethernet network card or a router). Every device that you can connect to a network has a unique MAC address which was given to it in the factory.</p>
<p class="p">This option can be used to change the MAC address of your network card.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="terms"><span class="gui">Cloned MAC address</span></dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">Your network hardware (wireless card) can pretend to have a different MAC address. This is useful if you have a device or service which will only communicate with a certain MAC address (for example, a cable broadband modem). If you put that MAC address into the <span class="gui">cloned MAC address</span> box, the device/service will think that your computer has the cloned MAC address rather than its real one.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms"><span class="gui">MTU</span></dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">This setting changes the <span class="em">Maximum Transmission Unit</span>, which is the maximum size of a chunk of data that can be sent over the network. When files are sent over a network, data is broken up into small chunks (or packets). The optimal MTU for your network will depend on how likely it is for packets to be lost (due to a noisy connection) and how fast the connection is. In general, you should not need to change this setting.</p></dd>

<p class="p">This defines what sort of <span class="em">encryption</span> your wireless network uses. Encrypted connections help protect your wireless connection from being intercepted, so other people can't "listen in" and see what websites you're visiting and so on.</p>

You'll normally need to type a password for the connection; more sophisticated types of security may also require a username and a digital "certificate".
