<p>

Partitioning your disk simply refers to the act of breaking up your
disk into sections. Each section is then independent of the others.
It's roughly equivalent to putting up walls inside a house; if you add
furniture to one room it doesn't affect any other room.

</p>
<p>

If you already have an operating system on your system





which uses the whole disk and you want to stick Ubuntu on the same disk, you will need to repartition
it. Ubuntu requires its own hard disk partitions. <span class="phrase">It cannot be
installed on Windows or Mac OS X partitions.</span> It may be able to share some
partitions with other Unix systems, but that's not covered here.
At the very least you will need a dedicated partition for the Ubuntu
root filesystem.


</p>
<p>
You can find information about your current partition setup by using
a partitioning tool for your current operating system<span class="phrase">, such as Disk Utility, Drive Setup, HD Toolkit, or MacTools</span>.
Partitioning tools always provide a way to show existing partitions without making changes.

</p>
<p>

In general, changing a partition with a file system already on
it will destroy any information there. Thus you should always make
backups before doing any repartitioning.  Using the analogy of the
house, you would probably want to move all the furniture out of the
way before moving a wall or you risk destroying it.

</p>
<p>

Several modern operating systems offer the ability to move and resize
certain existing partitions without destroying their contents.  This allows
making space for additional partitions without losing existing data.  Even
though this works quite well in most cases, making changes to the
partitioning of a disk is an inherently dangerous action and should only be
done after having made a full backup of all data.


</p>
<p>

Creating and deleting partitions can be done from within <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> as
well as from an existing operating system. As a rule of thumb,
partitions should be created by the system for which they are to
be used, i.e. partitions to be used by Ubuntu should be
created from within <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> and partitions to be used from another
operating system should be created from there. <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> is
capable of creating non-Linux partitions, and partitions created
this way usually work without problems when used in other operating
systems, but there are a few rare corner cases in which this could
cause problems, so if you want to be sure, use the native partitioning
tools to create partitions for use by other operating systems.
</p>
<p>

If you are going to install more than one operating system on the same
machine, you should install all other system(s) before proceeding with
the Ubuntu installation.<span class="phrase">Windows and other OS installations may destroy
your ability to start Ubuntu, or encourage you to reformat non-native partitions.</span>

</p>
<p>

You can recover from these actions or avoid them, but installing
the native system first saves you trouble.

</p>
<p>

In order for OpenFirmware to automatically boot Ubuntu the Linux
partitions should appear before all other partitions on the disk,
especially Mac OS X boot partitions. This should be kept in mind when
pre-partitioning; you should create a Linux placeholder partition to
come <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the other bootable partitions on the
disk. (The small partitions dedicated to Apple disk drivers are not
bootable.) You can delete the placeholder with the Ubuntu partition
tools later during the actual install, and replace it with Linux
partitions.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm45451287183904"></a>3.6.1. Mac OS X Partitioning</h3></div></div></div>
<p>

The <span class="application">Disk Utility</span> application can be found under the
<code class="filename">Utilities</code> menu in Mac OS X Installer. It will not adjust 
existing partitions; it is limited to partitioning the entire disk at once.

</p>
<p>

Remember to create a placeholder partition for GNU/Linux, preferably
positioned first in the disk layout. it doesn't matter what type it
is, it will be deleted and replaced later inside the Ubuntu installer.

</p>
<p>

Ubuntu installer partition table editing tools are compatible with OS X, 
but not with MacOS 9. If you are planning to use both MacOS 9 and OS X, it 
is best to install OS X and Ubuntu on one hard drive, and put MacOS 9 
on a separate hard drive.  Separate options for OS 9 and OS X will appear when 
holding the <span class="keycap"><strong>option</strong></span> key at boot time, and separate
options can be installed in the <span class="application">yaboot</span> boot menu as 
well. 

</p>
<p>

GNU/Linux is unable to access information on UFS partitions, but can access 
HFS+ (aka MacOS Extended) partitions. OS X requires one of these
two types for its boot partition. MacOS 9 can be installed on either HFS
(aka MacOS Standard) or HFS+. To share information between the Mac OS X and
GNU/Linux systems, an exchange partition is handy. HFS, HFS+ and MS-DOS FAT
file systems are supported by MacOS 9, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.
