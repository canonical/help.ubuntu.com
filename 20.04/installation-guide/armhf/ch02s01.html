<p>

Ubuntu does not impose hardware requirements beyond the requirements
of the Linux kernel and the GNU tool-sets.  Therefore, any
architecture or platform to which the Linux kernel, libc,
<span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>, etc. have been ported, and for which an Ubuntu
port exists, can run Ubuntu.


</p>
<p>

Rather than attempting to describe all the different hardware
configurations which are supported for <span class="phrase">32-bit hard-float ARMv7</span>, this section
contains general information and pointers to where additional
information can be found.

Ubuntu 20.04 supports six major architectures and several
variations of each architecture known as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">flavors</span>”</span>.
One other architecture (IBM/Motorola PowerPC) has an unofficial port.

<a name="idm281"></a>2.1.2. Variations in ARM CPU designs and support complexity</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
ARM systems are much more heterogeneous than those based on the
i386/amd64-based PC architecture, so the support situation can be much
more complicated.
</p>
<p>
The ARM architecture is used mainly in so-called
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">system-on-chip</span>”</span> (SoC) designs. These SoCs are designed
by many different companies with vastly varying hardware components
even for the very basic functionality required to bring the system
up. System firmware interfaces have been increasingly standardised
over time, but especially on older hardware firmware/boot interfaces
vary a great deal, so on these systems the Linux kernel has to take
care of many system-specific low-level issues which would be handled
by the mainboard's BIOS in the PC world.
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of the ARM support in the Linux kernel, the hardware
variety resulted in the requirement of having a separate kernel for
each ARM system in contrast to the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">one-fits-all</span>”</span> kernel
for PC systems.  As this approach does not scale to a large number of
different systems, work was done to allow booting with a single ARM
kernel that can run on different ARM systems.  Support for newer ARM
systems is now implemented in a way that allows the use of such a
multiplatform kernel, but for several older systems a separate
specific kernel is still required. Because of this, the standard
Ubuntu distribution only supports installation on
the newer systems which are
supported by the ARM multiplatform kernels
 in
Ubuntu/armhf.

            System support for Allwinner sunXi-based devices is limited to
            drivers and device-tree information available in the mainline
            Linux kernel.  The android-derived linux-sunxi.org 3.4 kernel
            series is not supported by Ubuntu.
          </p>
<p>
            The mainline Linux kernel generally supports serial console,
            ethernet, SATA, USB and MMC/SD-cards on Allwinner A10, A10s/A13
            and A20 SoCs, but it does not have native drivers for the
            display (HDMI/VGA/LCD) and audio hardware in these SoCs.  The
            NAND flash memory that is built into some sunXi-based systems is
            not supported.
          </p>
<p>
            Using a local display is technically possible without native
            display drivers via the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">simplefb</span>”</span> infrastructure
            in the mainline kernel, which relies on the
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">U-Boot</span>”</span> bootloader for initialising the display
            hardware.

            The Cubox-i series is a set of small, cubical-shaped systems
            based on the Freescale i.MX6 SoC family.  System support for
            the Cubox-i series is limited to drivers and device-tree
            information available in the mainline Linux kernel; the
            Freescale 3.0 kernel series for the Cubox-i is not supported by
            Ubuntu.  Available drivers in the mainline kernel include
            serial console, ethernet, USB, MMC/SD-card and display
            support over HDMI (console and X11). In addition to that,
            the eSATA port on the Cubox-i4Pro is supported.

<dd><p>
            The Wandboard Quad is a development board based on the Freescale
            i.MX6 Quad SoC.  System support for it is limited to drivers and
            device-tree information available in the mainline Linux kernel;
            the wandboard-specific 3.0 and 3.10 kernel series from
            wandboard.org are not supported by Ubuntu.  The mainline kernel
            includes driver support for serial console, display via HDMI
            (console and X11), ethernet, USB, MMC/SD and SATA.  Support for
            the onboard audio options (analog, S/PDIF, HDMI-Audio) and for
            the onboard WLAN/Bluetooth module is not available in Ubuntu
            20.04.

    Generally, the ARM multiplatform support in the Linux kernel
    allows running <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> on armhf systems not explicitly listed above,
    as long as the kernel used by <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> has support for the target
    system's components and a device-tree file for the target is
    available.  In these cases, the installer can usually provide a
    working installation, but it may not be able to automatically make
    the system bootable. Doing that in many cases requires
    device-specific information.
   
  </p>
<p>
    When using <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> on such systems, you may have to manually make
    the system bootable at the end of the installation, e.g. by
    running the required commands in a shell started from within
    <code class="classname">debian-installer</code>.

<a name="idm341"></a>2.1.4. Multiple Processors</h3></div></div></div>
<p>

Multiprocessor support — also called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">symmetric
multiprocessing</span>”</span> or SMP — is available for this architecture.
The standard Ubuntu 20.04 kernel image has been compiled with
<em class="firstterm">SMP-alternatives</em> support. This means that the kernel
will detect the number of processors (or processor cores) and will
automatically deactivate SMP on uniprocessor systems.

</p>
<p>
Having multiple processors in a computer was originally
only an issue for high-end server systems but has become common in
recent years nearly everywhere with
the introduction of so called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">multi-core</span>”</span> processors.  These contain
two or more processor units, called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cores</span>”</span>, in one physical chip.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="gfx"></a>2.1.5. Graphics Hardware Support</h3></div></div></div>
<p>  
Ubuntu's support for graphical interfaces is determined by the
underlying support found in X.Org's X11 system, and the kernel. Basic
framebuffer graphics is provided by the kernel, whilst desktop
environments use X11. Whether advanced graphics card features such as
3D-hardware acceleration or hardware-accelerated video are available,
depends on the actual graphics hardware used in the system and in some
cases on the installation of additional <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">firmware</span>”</span> images
(see <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html" title="2.2. Devices Requiring Firmware">Section 2.2, “Devices Requiring Firmware”</a>).

</p>
<p>

Nearly all ARM machines have the graphics hardware built-in, rather
than being on a plug-in card. Some machines do have expansion slots
which will take graphics cards, but that is a rarity. Hardware
designed to be headless with no graphics at all is quite common.
Whilst basic framebuffer video provided by the kernel should work on
all devices that have graphics, fast 3D graphics invariably needs
binary drivers to work. The situation is changing quickly but at
the time of the focal release free drivers for nouveau (Nvidia
Tegra K1 SoC) and freedreno (Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs) are available in
the release. Other hardware needs non-free drivers from 3rd parties.

</p>
<p>
Details on supported graphics hardware and pointing devices can be found at
<a class="ulink" href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org/" target="_top">http://xorg.freedesktop.org/</a>.  Ubuntu 20.04 ships
with X.Org version 7.7.

<p>

Almost any network interface card (NIC) supported by the Linux kernel
should also be supported by the installation system; drivers
should normally be loaded automatically.

<p>

On <span class="phrase">32-bit hard-float ARMv7</span>, most built-in Ethernet devices are supported and modules
for additional PCI and USB devices are provided.

Linux supports a large variety of hardware devices such as mice,
printers, scanners, PCMCIA/CardBus/ExpressCard and USB devices.  However, most of these
devices are not required while installing the system.
